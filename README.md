# Case Study: 
Automated screenshot generator:

Your task for the case study is to create an automated tool for taking screenshots of homepages of five selected webpages. There is a tool https://www.screenshotmachine.com/, which automatically creates these screenshots and even has an API. Please get familiar with this tool and the API and create an application that the API automatically saves these screenshots to Google Drive and then you share the Google Drive link with us. After you finish the case study upload your code to GitHub (or similar) and share it with us. Please make the code publicly accessible.
